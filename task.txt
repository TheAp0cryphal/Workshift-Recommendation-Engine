Project Document: AI-Powered Workforce Shift Optimization System

Objective
The objective of this project is to build an AI-powered recommendation system that optimizes workforce shift management by:
Identifying suitable employees based on skills, availability, and workload.
Handling last-minute shift cancellations by dynamically assigning replacements.
Managing workforce balance to prevent overstaffing and understaffing.
Implementing a reward/penalty system to encourage timely shift adherence.
The system will use Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and NLP to improve decision-making in workforce management.

Expected Outcomes
✅ Automated shift scheduling based on employee availability & skill set.
✅ Reduction in last-minute cancellations with penalties for repeat offenders.
✅ Faster shift replacements using a ranking-based recommendation engine.
✅ Optimized cost management by reducing overtime expenses.
✅ Fairness & transparency in workforce allocation using a point-based system.
